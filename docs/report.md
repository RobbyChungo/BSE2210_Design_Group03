Software Design in 2025: Process & Artifacts
Design as a Process: Software design is the iterative, decision-making process of transforming user needs and business requirements into a blueprint for a software system. In 2025, this is a collaborative, non-linear process involving constant feedback loops with stakeholders, developers, and even AI-assisted tools.
 Design as an Artifact: This is the tangible output of the design process. It's the collection of documents, diagrams, and models that describe the system's structure, behavior, and architecture for developers, testers, and stakeholders.

Analysis
    For a large, critical, and long-lasting system like USEP, a rigorous design process is non-negotiable. Rushing to code without a blueprint would lead to a fragile, unmaintainable system that fails to integrate with existing LMS/HR systems. The artifacts serve as a single source of truth, ensuring all team members and potential outsourcing partners are aligned, which is vital for a project of this scale and longevity.

Recommendation
    We recommend adopting a hybrid Agile design process with a "double diamond" approach for USEP. This means dedicated phases for discovery (diverging on the problem) and design (diverging on solutions), followed by convergence and implementation. This ensures we thoroughly understand the diverse student needs before committing to a technical solution.
    Furthermore, we will mandate the creation of two key artifacts:
    1.  A C4 Model Level 2 (Container Diagram):This artifact will show the high-level building blocks of USEP (e.g., Web Application, Mobile App, AI Service, Database, LMS Integration) and how they interact. It's perfect for communicating the overall system architecture to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
    2.  Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): For every significant technical choice (e.g., database technology, authentication method), we will create a short ADR. This documents the context, the decision, and its consequences. This is critical for ensuring design consistency over time, especially with a potentially changing team, and fulfills the "design that lasts" requirement.

MODERN DESIGN TRENDS
Microservices: An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services organized around business capabilities.
AI Integration (AI-Assisted Development & Features): The use of AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer) in the development process and the creation of AI-powered features within the application itself.
 Serverless Architecture: A cloud-native model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Developers write code in functions that are executed in response to events, without managing servers.

Analysis
Microservices are ideal for USEP's integration goals. Each service (Course Registration, Advising, Events) can be developed, scaled, and updated independently. This allows different teams to work concurrently and prevents a failure in one service (e.g., Financial Aid) from bringing down the entire platform.
AI Integration is twofold. First, AI-assisted tools can boost developer productivity. Second, as required, AI-powered features like the academic advisor chatbot are a core value proposition for students.
Serverless functions are perfect for specific, event-driven tasks within USEP, such as processing a form submission, sending a loan repayment alert, or generating a report. They reduce operational overhead and can be more cost-effective for sporadic workloads.

Recommendation 
We recommend a core architecture based on Microservices for USEP's major business domains. This directly supports scalability and long-term maintainability.
We advocate for the strategic use of Serverless functions for event-based background tasks to optimize costs and development speed.
We must integrate AI tooling into our development pipeline and carefully design the AI advising feature with ethical considerations in mind (see Member C's section). This trend is essential for staying modern and efficient.

APPLICATION-FIRST VS. PRINCIPLES-FIRST APPROACH

Application-First: This approach starts with the end goal—the working application—and makes design decisions based on what gets the product to market fastest. Principles and standards may be applied retroactively.
Principles-First: This approach begins by establishing a core set of design principles, standards, and architectural patterns (e.g., "data privacy by design," "API-first," "accessibility first"). All subsequent design decisions are evaluated against these guiding principles.

Analysis
An Application-First approach might get a minimal version of USEP launched quicker but would likely result in a system that is difficult to scale, secure, and maintain. It would risk creating more technical debt and could compromise on non-functional requirements like accessibility and security.
A Principles-First approach aligns perfectly with the university's mandate for "design that lasts beyond 2025." It ensures that from the very beginning, the system is built on a strong, coherent foundation that respects constraints like diversity, integration, and ethical AI.

Recommendation 
We strongly recommend a Principles-First approach for the USEP project. The scale, complexity, and long-term strategic importance of this platform demand it.
We should define our core design principles in our first team meeting.These should include:
Scalability First: The architecture must handle growth in users and services.
Accessibility by Design: The UI must be accessible to all students from day one.
API-First: All services will be built with well-defined APIs to ensure seamless integration, both internally and with external systems (LMS/HR).
Ethical AI: AI features must be fair, transparent, and unbiased.
Starting with these principles will guide every other technical and design choice, ensuring a cohesive, sustainable, and high-quality platform.

THE BUSINESS CASE

Fragmented Services: Students currently have to juggle multiple disconnected systems (LMS for courses, a separate portal for finances, another for events). This leads to frustration, missed deadlines, and a poor student experience.
Inefficiency: University staff also waste time managing data across these separate systems instead of providing proactive support.
International Student Challenges:The lack of a unified, culturally intelligent platform can alienate international students, potentially affecting retention and the university's global reputation.

Proposed Solution: The USEP
Briefly describe USEP as a single, integrated platform that brings all academic, support, and community services into one seamless experience.
Mention key features like AI-powered advising, integrated financial aid tracking, and a unified events calendar.

Expected Value & Benefits 
This is the most critical part. Frame the benefits in terms the university leadership cares about:
For Students:
Improved Retention & Satisfaction: A smoother, less stressful experience keeps students happy and enrolled.
Faster Time to Resolution:Students get answers and solve problems (academic, financial) faster through a centralized system.
For the University (Operational Efficiency):
Reduced Administrative Overhead: Automate processes (e.g., enrollment queries handled by AI chatbot), freeing staff for complex tasks.
Better Data-Driven Decisions:A unified system provides holistic data on student behavior, allowing for better resource allocation and proactive support.
Competitive Advantage:A modern, scalable platform makes the university more attractive to prospective students.

Outsourcing Analysis
Onshore: Hiring a development team within the same country.
Pros: Easier communication (same time zone, language, culture), higher quality control, better IP protection.
Cons: Most expensive option.
Offshore:Hiring a development team in a distant, low-cost country (e.g., India, Philippines).
Pros: Significant cost savings.
Cons: Major challenges with time zones, cultural/language barriers, and potential quality concerns. Requires excellent project management.
Nearshore: Hiring a team in a nearby country (e.g., For Zambia, this could be a team in South Africa, Kenya, or Nigeria).
 Pros:Good balance of cost savings and manageable time zone overlap (e.g., 1-2 hours difference). Often similar cultural contexts.

Recommendation:
Given the project's constraints (limited budget, need for "design that lasts," diverse international user base), I recommend a Hybrid or Nearshore model.
Justification:
   Budget: Pure onshore is likely too expensive.
   Quality & Communication: Pure offshore introduces too much risk for a core, strategic platform like the USEP. Miscommunication could lead to a product that doesn't meet the nuanced needs of the students.
 Ideal Compromise: A Nearshore team offers cost benefits while minimizing communication and cultural barriers. Alternatively, the university could use an Onshore core team for architecture and project management while offshoring/nearshoring specific, well-defined development tasks.



CULTURE & OPS LEAD

Cultural Intelligence in Design
   Cultural Intelligence (CQ) in software design is the capability to create products that are effective, accessible, and respectful across different cultures, languages, and abilities. It moves beyond translation to include deep inclusivity in imagery, workflows, symbols, and overall user experience.

Analysis
  USEP's mandate to serve a diverse, international student body makes CQ a core functional requirement, not a "nice-to-have." A platform that is difficult for a visually impaired student to use, or that uses culturally specific idioms confusing to non-native speakers, will fail in its goal to unify the student experience. It can alienate users, create barriers to education, and expose the university to legal and reputational risk.

Recommendation
We must mandate two concrete, non-negotiable requirements from the outset:
    WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance: This is the global standard for web accessibility. It ensures the platform is usable by students with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities. This includes screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, color contrast ratios, and clear error messages.
    Design for Localization (l10n): The UI/UX must be built from the ground up to support multiple languages. This means:
1. Using internationalization (i18n) frameworks.
2. Avoiding text in images.
3. Ensuring UI elements can accommodate longer text strings (common in languages like German or French).
        Using culturally neutral icons and symbols.
        We recommend launching with support for the top 5 languages spoken by the student body, with a framework to easily add more.

 DevOps & DevSecOps
    DevOps: A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the system development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. It is enabled by a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline  that automates testing and deployment.
   DevSecOps: The philosophy of integrating security practices (Sec) into the DevOps pipeline. It means making security a shared responsibility and addressing it at every phase of development, not just at the end.

Analysis 
    A manual, infrequent release process would be a major liability for a platform as critical as USEP. DevOps is essential for:
   Speed & Reliability: Quickly delivering new features and bug fixes to students with confidence.
   Scalability: Automatically managing the build, test, and deployment of Member A's recommended microservices.
   Quality: Automated testing in the pipeline catches bugs early when they are cheaper to fix.
    DevSecOps is non-negotiable because USEP will handle highly sensitive student data (academic, financial, personal). A security breach would be catastrophic. "Bolting on" security after development is ineffective and risky.

Recommendation 
We must implement a CI/CD pipeline with DevSecOps "shift-left" principles from day one.This means integrating security scans early in the development process.
Basic CI/CD Pipeline Diagram for USEP:


    Key Tools/Services: We recommend using GitHub Actions/GitLab CI or Azure DevOps to orchestrate this. Key steps include SAST (Static Application Security Testing) to scan code for vulnerabilities and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) to scan the running application.
    This automated, secure pipeline is the engine that makes the "design that lasts" sustainable, allowing us to update and secure the platform efficiently for years to come.

AI Awareness: Opportunity & Ethical Concern
    AI offers transformative potential but introduces significant ethical challenges that must be proactively managed.

Analysis    
Opportunity (AI-Powered Academic Advising): The proposed AI advisor is the key opportunity. It can provide 24/7 support, answer routine questions, help students plan courses based on historical success data, and flag at-risk students for human intervention. This directly improves student outcomes and operational efficiency.
Ethical Concern (Bias and Fairness): The major risk is that the AI model is trained on historical data that may contain hidden biases. For example, it might disproportionately recommend "easier" career paths to students from certain demographics or underestimate the potential of students from non-traditional backgrounds, thereby perpetuating existing inequalities.

Recommendation 
We must treat the AI advisor as a high-potential, high-risk component that requires an ethical framework.
For the Opportunity: Proceed with development, but design it as a hybrid system. The AI handles common queries and flags issues, but it must seamlessly escalate to a human advisor for complex, sensitive, or ambiguous situations.
For the Ethical Concern: Implement a Bias Audit Protocol. This includes:
Curating Diverse Training Data: Actively ensuring the data represents the entire student population.
Continuous Monitoring: Regularly testing the AI's recommendations across different demographic groups for disparate outcomes.
Transparency: Being clear with students that they are interacting with an AI and explaining how its suggestions are generated.
    Ethical AI is not a barrier; it is a prerequisite for a trustworthy and effective platform.
