Project Overview
This repository contains our team's submission for Assignment 1: Foundations of Modern Software Design. The project involves proposing an introductory design vision for a Unified Student Experience Platform (USEP), focusing on processes, artifacts, and cultural/business considerations.

 Contribution Summary
Each team member took the lead on their respective areas as outlined in the assignment brief:

Robby Chungo (Member A):
1.Research and content on Software Design in 2025 (Process & Artifacts).
2.  Analysis and recommendations for modern Design Trends (Microservices, AI, Serverless).
3.   Leading the argument for a Principles-First approach for USEP.
4.   Creation of initial architectural artifacts (C4 Model outline).

Chandi Chileshe (Member B):
Development of the Business Case, defining the problem, solution, and expected value.
1.Comprehensive analysis of  Outsourcing  models (Onshore, Offshore, Nearshore).
2. Formulating the final recommendation for Onshore outsourcing and defending its cost-benefit analysis.
3.Ensuring the business perspective was integrated into all design discussions.

John Mwando (Member C):
     Research and definition of Cultural Intelligence requirements (WCAG compliance, Localization).
1.  Design and explanation of the DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline diagram.
2. Analysis of AI Awareness, identifying opportunities (Advising Bot) and ethical concerns (Bias).
3.  Leading the ethical and operational considerations throughout the design.

All members contributed to:
1. Collaborative brainstorming and peer-reviewing each other's sections.
2.  Actively participating in the recorded group discussion and debate.
3. Finalizing the report and ensuring consistency across all sections.

 Reflection on AI Use
In completing this assignment, our team used generative AI tools as a catalyst for research and ideation, while ensuring all critical thinking and final decision-making remained a human-driven process.

How AI was used:
 Brainstorming and Idea Generation: We used AI to generate initial ideas and examples for modern software trends, ethical concerns with AI, and potential cultural intelligence features. This helped us overcome initial blank-page syndrome and expand our thinking.
    Overcoming Research Roadblocks: When we encountered unfamiliar terms (e.g., "SAST/DAST," "Principles-first"), we used AI to get concise, initial definitions to guide our deeper, more traditional research.
    Formatting and Structuring: We used AI to suggest professional structures for our report and README file, ensuring clarity and adherence to academic standards.

What remained human-driven:
   Critical Analysis and Application: All analysis of how trends apply to the specific USEP context, including the final recommendations for architecture, outsourcing, and ethics, was done by the team. We did not accept AI conclusions at face value; we debated and validated them against the project constraints.
    Creation of Artifacts: The final CI/CD pipeline diagram and its composition were designed by the team based on our understanding of DevOps principles. AI was not used to generate diagrams.
    Combining of Ideas: Combining research from various sources, forming coherent arguments, and crafting the final narrative of our report and discussion was entirely human-led.
  The Live Discussion: The recorded conversation was an authentic, unscripted debate among team members. Our questions, challenges, and defenses were spontaneous and reflected our own understanding and viewpoints.

In line with academic integrity policies, this reflection honestly discloses the extent of AI use in our process.
